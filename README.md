# Stink-O-meter
Created a Air quality detection system for washrooms that send data to the
cloud platform of Thigs Speak where the data is represented in graphical format.
This System detects the drop in the quality of washrooms or any room for that matter
and after a certain threshold limit is surpassed it sends a notification to the responsible person to attend the matter.
